# CS6907 Neural Networks Project Submission

### Overview

This project will consist of implementing the Doc2Vec network in 


### Scope Changes

Initially I started using the tf doc2vec model, after having some struggles with initial tf doc2vec tests I found the following threads that indicated gensim may be better than tf for doc2vec.  I wanted to use tf initially because I have used gensim in the past more than tf, however it seemed like the best bet for this project.
